\# This program displays my knowledge of loops in Python. In this interactive game, 3 concept loops are used:



1. While loops (Collatz Conjecture)
2. For loops (Prime Number Checker)
3. Nested - For loops (Multiplication Table)







\## \*\*Challenge 1: Collatz Conjecture\*\*

* For this challenge, I used while loops in my code. The reason for the while loop is to allow a sequence of numbers to be outputted until the number reached 1, in which the program would end. 
* While loops are the better choice to use when a number of iterations are unknown.





\## \*\*Challenge 2: Prime Number Checker\*\*

* For this challenge, I used for loops in my code. The reason for the for loop is check between a range of numbers.
* It checks divisibility between the range of numbers to determine if that number is prime or not.
* Using for loops is the better choice when you're given a range of numbers.





\## \*\*Challenge 3: Multiplication Grid\*\*

* For this challenge, I used nested (for) loops in my code. The reason for this is so I could loop over rows and columns to make a multiplication grid.
* It prints out a 10 by 10 grid, using rows and columns
* Nested loops are good when you need to repeat an iteration within another iteration.







\# How My Solutions Work

\## \*\*Challenge 1:\*\*

* Input: Enter starting number
* While loop is used, until number = 1
* Even number, divided by 2
* Odd number, multiplied by 3, add 1
* Each number is outputted and steps increase



\## \*\*Challenge 2:\*\*

* Input: Enter a number.
* For loop is used, tests divisors from 2 up to number (input).
* Even divsors, not a prime number
* No divisors, prime number



\## \*\*Challenge 3:\*\*

* 2 for loops used, created a 10 by 10 multiplication grid
* Outer loop outputs rows
* Inner loop outputs columns (also forms a grid)







\# AI Usage

Throughout this assignment, I used ChatGPT to help clarify concepts, errors that came up and reviewed my code that I have written. ChatGPT also helped me format the README in a more concise way. Other than that, all decisions, code, and testing was done by me.
